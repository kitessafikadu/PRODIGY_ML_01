# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, location, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. The model is built using **Linear Regression**, a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (house price) and one or more independent variables (features).

## Project Details

- **Objective**: Predict house prices based on historical data using linear regression.
- **Algorithm Used**: Linear Regression
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `sklearn`: For building the linear regression model and evaluating performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains several features, including but not limited to:
- **Square Footage**: The size of the house in square feet.
- **Number of Bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Location**: The neighborhood or area where the house is located.
- **Year Built**: The year the house was constructed.
- **Price**: The target variable (house price).

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and inspect the data.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical form if necessary (e.g., encoding location).
   
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Choose the most relevant features for predicting house prices.
   
3. **Modeling**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a linear regression model on the training data.
   
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**.
   
5. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices on new data.
